# My DWM Config

## About
I started this project inspired by Chris Titus's "dwm-titus" and "debian-titus," though it is not a fork of his project. It is a fork of Suckless's DWM, Dmenu, and SLStatus, however, with these all put together in one project for ease of install with all my tweaks. Generally just trying to make it a little bit prettier and add some functionality for laptops.

## Installation
Run the `install.sh` script included to install all dependencies for building DWM on Debian, Arch, and OpenSuSE based distrobutions, alongside a few other base programs. These include feh, rofi, picom, git, kitty, thunar, pavucontrol, firefox, and flatpak, and will provide a suitable starting environment with a few default graphical apps and multiple ways of installing software. 

Secondarily, Debian-based distros will have the edition of `nala`, a very pretty frontend for `apt`, and Arch users will have access to `paru` as an AUR helper. This should make for a nice out-of-the-box experience and just make things go a little faster.

The install script will also add Nordzy Cursors by alvatip and the Nordic theme by EliverLara. The included wallpaper is the default Debian 12 "Emerald theme," designed by Juliette Taka.
